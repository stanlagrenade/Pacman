# Pacman

## Description

This project demonstrates the power of JavaScript to generate animations by manipulating the DOM. The DOM is manipulated using loops, functions to show movement and screen edge detection is leveraged to create a bouncing effect. Finally, multiple images are leveraged and rotated to create the effect of movement with Pacman's mouth.
